# Automation
this code is a demonstration of how you can make computing almost hands free by selenium automation by using python (the easiest language in my opinion).Here, i open youtube and search for a particular channel just by running the above code.This can be done in any browser and yes, everything done for educational purposes only.
make sure you install the selenium package first in python ny opening cmd and typing : pip install selenium
